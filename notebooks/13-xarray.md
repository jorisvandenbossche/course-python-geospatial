```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import rasterio
from rasterio.plot import plotting_extent, reshape_as_image
```

## Introduction

+++

By this moment you probably already know how to read data files with rasterio:

```{code-cell} ipython3
data_file = "./data/gent/raster/2020-09-17_Sentinel_2_L1C_True_color.tiff"
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
with rasterio.open(data_file) as src:
    # extract data, metadata and extent into memory
    gent_profile = src.profile
    gent_data = src.read([1, 2, 3], out_dtype=float, masked=False)
    gent_ext = plotting_extent(src)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
plt.imshow(gent_data[0, :, :], extent=gent_ext, cmap="Reds")
```

Rasterio...

__Benefits__
 - Direct link with Numpy data types
 - Rasterio supports important GIS transformations (clip, mask, warp, merge, transformation,...)
 - Only load a subset of a large data set into memory

__Drawbacks__:
 - Coordinate information is decoupled from the data itself (keep track and organize the extent and meta data) 
 - Make sure to keep track of what each dimension represents (y-first, as arrays are organized along rows first)
 - Functionality overlap with GDAL (and sometimes installation issues)

+++

## Meet `xarray`

```{code-cell} ipython3
import xarray as xr
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
gent = xr.open_rasterio(data_file)
gent
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
plt.imshow(gent.sel(band=1), cmap="Reds");
```

Xarray brings its own plotting methods, but relies on Matplotlib as well for the actual plotting:

```{code-cell} ipython3
ax = gent.sel(band=1).plot.imshow(cmap="Reds", figsize=(12, 5))  # robust=True
# ax.axes.set_aspect('equal')
```

As a preview, plot the intersection of the data at x coordinate closest to 400000 for each band:

```{code-cell} ipython3
gent.sel(x=400_000, method='nearest').plot.line(col='band')
```

But first, let's have a look at the data again:

```{code-cell} ipython3
gent
```

The output of xarray is a bit different to what we've previous seen. Let's go through the different elements:

- It is a `xarray.DataArray`, one of the main data types provided by xarray
- It has 3 __dimensions__:
    - `band`: 3 bands (RGB)
    - `y`: the y coordinates of the data set
    - `x`: the x coordinates of the data set
- Each of these dimensions are defined by a __coordinate__ (1D) array
- Other metadata provided by the `tiff` are stored in the __`Attributes`__

Looking to the data itself (click on the icons on the right), we can see this is still a Numpy array

```{code-cell} ipython3
#gent.values
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
gent = gent.assign_coords(band=("band", ["R", "G", "B"]))
gent
```

Hence, we can __name dimensions__ and also extract (slice) data using these names...

```{code-cell} ipython3
gent.sel(band='R')
```

Using xarray:

- Data stored as a Numpy arrays
- Dimensions do have a name
- The coordinates of each of the dimensions can represent coordinates, categories, dates,... instead of just an index

+++

<div class="alert alert-info" style="font-size:120%">

**REMEMBER**: <br>

The [`xarray` package](xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) introduces __labels__ in the form of dimensions, coordinates and attributes on top of raw numPy-like arrays. Xarray is inspired by and borrows heavily from Pandas.    

</div>

+++

## Numpy with labels...

+++

Recap the NDVI exercise of the Numpy notebook, using a stacked version of the 4th and 8th Sentinel band:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_array = xr.open_rasterio("./data/gent/raster/2020-09-17_Sentinel_2_L1C_B0408.tiff")
xr_array
```

In Numpy, we would do:

```{code-cell} ipython3
b48_bands = xr_array.values  # 0 is band 4 and 1 is band 8
b48_bands.shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ndvi_np = (b48_bands[1] - b48_bands[0])/(b48_bands[0] + b48_bands[1]) # or was it b48_bands[0] -  b48_bands[1] ?
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
plt.imshow(ndvi_np, cmap="YlGn")
```

In __xarray__:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_array = xr_array.assign_coords(band=("band", ["b4", "b8"]))
xr_data = xr_array.to_dataset(dim="band")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ndvi_xr = (xr_data["b8"] - xr_data["b4"])/(xr_data["b8"] + xr_data["b4"])
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
plt.imshow(ndvi_xr, cmap="YlGn")
```

The result is the same, but no more struggling on what index is representing which variable!

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.allclose(ndvi_xr.data, ndvi_np)
```

We can keep the result together with the other data variables by adding a new variable to the data, in a very similar way as we created a new column in Pandas:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_data["ndvi"] = ndvi_xr
xr_data
```

You already encountered `xarray.DataArray`, but now we created a `xarray.Dataset`:

- A `xarray.Dataset` is the second main data type provided by xarray
- It has 2 __dimensions__:
    - `y`: the y coordinates of the data set
    - `x`: the x coordinates of the data set
- Each of these dimensions are defined by a __coordinate__ (1D) array
- It has 3 __Data variables__: `band_4`, `band_8` and `ndvi` that share the same coordinates
- Other metadata provided by the `tiff` are stored in the __`Attributes`__

Looking to the data itself (click on the icons on the right), we can see each of the _Data variables_ is a Numpy ndarrays:

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(xr_data["b4"].data)
```

And also the coordinates that describe a dimension are Numpy ndarrays:

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(xr_data.coords["x"].values)
```

__Selecting data__

+++

Xarray’s labels make working with multidimensional data much easier:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_array = xr.open_rasterio("./data/gent/raster/2020-09-17_Sentinel_2_L1C_B0408.tiff")
```

Rename the coordinates of the band dimension:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_array = xr_array.assign_coords(band=("band", ["b4", "b8"]))
```

We could use the Numpy style of data slicing:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_array[0]
```

However, it is often much more powerful to use xarray’s `.sel()` method to use label-based indexing:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_array.sel(band="b4")
```

We can select a specific set of coordinate values as a __list__ and take the value that is most near to the given value:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_array.sel(x=[406803, 410380, 413958], method="nearest")   # .sel(band="b4").plot.line(hue="x");
```

Sometimes, a specific range is required. The `.sel()` method also supports __slicing__, so we can select band 4 and slice a subset of the data along the x direction:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_array.sel(x=slice(400_000, 420_000), band="b4").plot.imshow()
```

__Note__ Switch in between `Array` and `Datasets` as you like, it won't hurt your computer memory:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_data = xr_array.to_dataset(dim="band")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#xr_data.to_array()    # dim="band"
```

### Reduction

+++

Just like in numpy, we can reduce xarray DataArrays along any number of axes:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_data["b4"].mean(axis=0).dims
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_data["b4"].mean(axis=1).dims
```

But we have __dimensions with labels__, so rather than performing reductions on axes (as in Numpy), we can perform them on __dimensions__. This turns out to be a huge convenience:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_data["b4"].mean(dim="x").dims
```

Calculate minimum or quantile values for each of the bands separately:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_array.min(dim=["x", "y"])
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_array.quantile([0.1, 0.5, 0.9], dim=["x", "y"])
```

### Element-wise computation

+++

Xarray DataArrays and Datasets work seamlessly with arithmetic operators and numpy array functions.

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_data["b4"] /10.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.log(xr_data["b8"])
```

As we seen in the example of the NDVI, we can combine multiple xarray datasets in arithemetic operations:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_data["b8"] + xr_data["b4"]
```

### Broadcasting

+++

Perfoming an operation on arrays with differenty coordinates will result in automatic broadcasting:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_data.x.shape, xr_data["b8"].shape
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_data["b8"] + xr_data.x  # Note, this calculaton does not make much sense, but illustrates broadcasting
```

## Plotting

+++

Similar to Pandas, there is a `plot` method, which can be used for different plot types:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_array = xr.open_rasterio("./data/gent/raster/2020-09-17_Sentinel_2_L1C_B0408.tiff")
xr_array = xr_array.assign_coords(band=("band", ["b4", "b8"]))
```

It supports both 2 dimensional (e.g. line) as 3 (e.g. imshow, pcolormesh) dimensional plots. When just using `plot`, xarray will do a _best guess_ on how to plot the data. However being explicit `plot.line`, `plot.imshow`, `plot.pcolormesh`, `plot.scatter`,...  gives you more control.

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_array.sel(band="b4").plot();  # add .line() -> ValueError: For 2D inputs, please specify either hue, x or y.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_array.sel(x=420000, method="nearest").plot.line(hue="band");
```

`facetting` splits the data in subplots according to a dimension, e.g. `band`

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_array.sel(x=420000, method="nearest").plot.line(col="band");  # row="band"
```

Use the `robust` option when there is a lack of visual difference. This will use the 2nd and 98th percentiles of the data to compute the color limits. The arrows on the color bar indicate that the colors include data points outside the bounds.

```{code-cell} ipython3
ax = xr_array.sel(band="b4").plot(cmap="Reds", robust=True, figsize=(12, 5))
ax.axes.set_aspect('equal')
```

Compare data variables within a `xarray Dataset`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_data = xr_array.to_dataset(dim="band")
xr_data.plot.scatter(x="b4", y="b8", s=2)
```

Calculating and plotting the NDVI in three classes illustrates the options of the `imshow` method:

```{code-cell} ipython3
xr_data["ndvi"] = (xr_data["b8"] - xr_data["b4"])/(xr_data["b8"] + xr_data["b4"])
xr_data["ndvi"].plot.imshow(levels=[-1, 0, 0.3, 1.], colors=["gray", "yellowgreen", "g"])
```

# Let's practice!

+++

The data set for the following exercises is from [Argo floats](https://argo.ucsd.edu/), an international collaboration that collects high-quality temperature and salinity profiles from the upper 2000m of the ice-free global ocean and currents from intermediate depths.

These data do not represent full coverage image data (like remote sensing images), but measurements of salinity and temperature as a function of water `level` (related to the pressure). Each measurements happens at a given `date` on a given location (`lon`/`lat`).

```{code-cell} ipython3
import xarray as xr
argo = xr.load_dataset("./data/argo_float.nc")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
argo
```

The bold font (or * symbol in plain text output version) in the coordinate representation above indicates that x and y are 'dimension coordinates' (they describe the coordinates associated with data variable axes) while band is a 'non-dimension coordinates'. We can make any variable a non-dimension coordinate.

+++

Let's plot the coordinates of the available measurements and add a background map using [contextly](https://contextily.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html):

```{raw-cell}
import contextily as cx
from pyproj import CRS
crs = CRS.from_epsg(4326)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6))
argo.plot.scatter(x='lon', y='lat', ax=ax, color='red', s=2)

# Custom adjustments of the limits, as we are in the middle of the ocean
xmin, xmax = ax.get_xlim()
ymin, ymax = ax.get_ylim()
ax.set_xlim(xmin*1.5, xmax*0.5)
ax.set_ylim(ymin*0.5, ymax*1.5)

cx.add_basemap(ax, crs=crs.to_string())
```

## Pandas for multiple dimensions...

```{code-cell} ipython3
argo = xr.load_dataset("./data/argo_float.nc")
```

If we are interested in the _average over time_ for each of the levels, we can use a reducton function to get the averages of each of the variables at the same time:

```{code-cell} ipython3
argo.mean(dim=["date"])
```

But if we wanted the _average for each month of the year_ per level, we would first have to __split__ the data set in a group for each month of the year, __apply__ the average function on each of the months and __combine__ the data again. 

We already learned about the [split-apply-combine](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html) approach when using Pandas. The syntax of Xarray’s groupby is almost identical to Pandas!

+++

First, extract the month of the year (1-> 12) from each of the date coordinates:

```{code-cell} ipython3
argo.date.dt.month  # The coordinates is a Pandas datetime index
```

We can use these arrays in a groupby operation:

```{code-cell} ipython3
argo.groupby(argo.date.dt.month)
```

Xarray also offers a more concise syntax when the variable you're grouping on is already present in the dataset. This is identical to the previous line:

```{code-cell} ipython3
argo.groupby("date.month")
```

Next, we apply an aggregation function _for each of the months_ over the `date` dimension in order to end up with: _for each month of the year, the average (over time) for each of the levels_:

```{code-cell} ipython3
argo.groupby("date.month").mean(dim="date")        #["temperature"].sel(level=1).to_series().plot.barh()
```

Another (alike) operation - specifically for time series data - is to `resample` the data to another time-aggregation. For example, resample to monthly (`1M`) or yearly (`1Y`) median values:

```{code-cell} ipython3
argo.resample(date="1M").median()  # 1Y
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
argo["salinity"].sel(level=1).plot.line(x="date");
argo["salinity"].resample(date="1M").median().sel(level=1).plot.line(x="date");  # 1Y
```

A similar, but different functionality is `rolling` to calculate rolling window aggregates:

```{code-cell} ipython3
argo.rolling(level=10, center=True).std()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
argo["salinity"].sel(date='2012-10-31').plot.line(y="level", yincrease=False, color="grey");
argo["salinity"].sel(date='2012-10-31').rolling(level=10, center=True).median().plot.line(y="level", yincrease=False, linewidth=3, color="crimson");
plt.legend(), plt.title("");
```

<div class="alert alert-info" style="font-size:120%">

**REMEMBER**: <br>

The [xarray `groupby`](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/groupby.html) with the same syntax as Pandas implements the __split-apply-combine__ strategy. Also [`resample`](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/time-series.html#resampling-and-grouped-operations) and [`rolling`](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/computation.html?highlight=rolling#rolling-window-operations) are available in xarray.
    
__Note:__ Xarray adds a [`groupby_bins`](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.groupby_bins.html#xarray.Dataset.groupby_bins) convenience function for binned groups (instead of each value).
